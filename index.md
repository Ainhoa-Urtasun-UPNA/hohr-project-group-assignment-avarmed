### Recruitment Process:

1) Job posting where the employer starts recruiting for the job opening for which there is work available by advertising a description of the job.

2) Sorting and screening out job candidates happens. Here is where the Hiring process begins:

In the first step, the candidates that want to postulate to our vacancies have to submit a resume and credentials, which are documents, certifying the person’s skills.
Then, every candidate has to complete a psychotechnical exam in order for us to measure their behaviors, abilities and skills. This is done to know if they possess the qualities necessary to perform the job 
The third step consists in an interview.  Here, we will be explaining in detail the job and the tasks the candidate will have to perform in case he/her is hired. In this part we will also ask some general, open questions to get to know them better, and analyze their interaction skills.
After that, the last step will be a practical part. The applicant will solve some practical problems and cases that could be presented in their “future” job.

3)Onboarding. After we decide who to hire and who not to, we communicate the news to the applicants and welcome them to our company.
